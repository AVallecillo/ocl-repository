The OCL Repository
==============

A repository for examples of all kinds of OCL (Object Constraint Language) expressions. 


Can I collaborate?
------------------

Absolutely!. We're not going to create anything useful on our own so please help us make something relevant for the community.

How to contribute?
------------------

Fork the project and submit your pull request. Make sure your example is created as a new folder unde the /academic (for academic or artificial toy examples), 
/industrial (for OCL expressions specified as part of a real software project) or /standards (for OCL expressions used in the definition of a standard specification) folder and 
includes at least the following:

* An .ocl text file with the list of OCL expressions of your example
* A graphic representation of the  model using those OCL expressions 
* (Ideally) That same model stored in some kind of machine-processable format like XMI
* A description.txt file with all the details you consider relevant to analyze your example, including at least the modeling tool used. 

(not sure this submission schema works for your example?, questions about what to submit?, just get in touch or send a pull request to start the discussion)


Other useful OCL-related stuff
------------------

Not the main goal of the repository but feel free to add also other OCL-related links, documents, tools in the otherOCLstuff folder.
